The key to more success is to get a massage once a week, very important, major key, cloth talk. Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started.

Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat.

Always remember in the jungle there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. We the best. Special cloth alert. Another one. Always remember in the jungle there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. We don’t see them, we will never see them.
